# Binary Search Tree Exercises

We've supplied you with a ***Node*** class and a constructor for the ***BinarySearchTree*** class. Here are descriptions of the methods you should write for instances of ***BinarySearchTree***:

### Methods

- [x] **insert** 

This function should insert a node in a binary tree. It should return the BinarySearchTree and should be solved using iteration.

- [x] **insertRecursively** 

This function should insert a node in a binary tree. It should return the BinarySearchTree and should be solved using recursion.

- [x] **find** 

This function should find a node in a binary tree. It should return the node if found, otherwise return ***null***. This should be solved using iteration.

- [x] **findRecursively** 

This function should find a node in a binary tree. It should return the node if found, otherwise return ***null***. This should be solved using iteration.

- [x] **dfsPreOrder** 

This function should search through each node in a binary tree using pre-order depth-first search and return an array containing each node's value.

- [x] **dfsInOrder** 

This function should search through each node in a binary tree using in-order depth-first search and return an array containing each node's value.

- [x] **dfsPostOrder** 

This function should search through each node in a binary tree using post-order depth-first search and return an array containing each node's value.

- [x] ***bfs***

This function should search through each node in the binary search tree using breadth first search and return an array containing each node's value.
